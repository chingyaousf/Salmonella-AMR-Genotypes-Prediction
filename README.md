# **Salmonella AMR Genotypes Prediction**

## **Overview:**

This repository contains the code for predicting Salmonella Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genotypes using machine learning models. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, the [Pathogen Detection Salmonella Enterica dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/pathogen-detection-salmonella-enterica/data).

## **About the Dataset:**

### **Introduction to Pathogen Detection**

Advances in DNA sequencing technology have revolutionized the analysis of microbial genomes, allowing for rapid and efficient sequencing. Access to complete microbial DNA sequences provides opportunities to understand microorganisms at the molecular level, aiding in pathogen detection and drug development. This dataset focuses on Salmonella enterica, a Gram-negative bacterium with various serovars known for causing salmonellosis.

### **Pathogen Detection Mechanism**

Pathogens carry unique DNA or RNA signatures, differentiating them from other organisms. Developing these signatures is crucial for rapid and specific pathogen detection.

### **Pathogen Detection Applications**

Pathogen detection plays a crucial role in various fields, including biodefense, animal health care, food safety, diagnostics, pathology, clinical research, forensics, and drug discovery.

### **About Salmonella Enterica**

Salmonella enterica is a Gram-negative bacterium, often responsible for foodborne infections in humans. It infects various animals, including cattle and poultry, making it a significant concern for public health.

### **Dataset Content**

The dataset includes information used for automated real-time analyses, such as clustering related pathogen genome sequences and screening genomic sequences for antimicrobial resistance, stress response, and virulence genes.

## **Data Exploration and Analysis:**

The exploratory data analysis and visualization were performed using the Kaggle dataset. The initial analysis notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/raj-rajat/Pathogen-Detection-Salmonella-Enterica/blob/13496703e594cf8747b256aad1e30920aa242519/pathogen-detection-salmonella-enterica.ipynb).
